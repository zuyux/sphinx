    "question": "In light of the recent emission of a powerful X9.0-class solar flare captured by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, what protection protocols should be in place for energy and technological infrastructures in response to future extreme solar events?",
    "context": "Such extreme solar events can cause geomagnetic storms that affect the Earth's magnetic field, disrupting radio communications, GPS navigation systems, and causing fluctuations in electrical grids. The charged particles released by the flare can induce geomagnetic currents in high-voltage lines, transformers, and electrical equipment, causing permanent damage and regional blackouts. Furthermore, satellites and space stations are also at risk, as the intense radiation can damage their electronic components and alter their orbit."
